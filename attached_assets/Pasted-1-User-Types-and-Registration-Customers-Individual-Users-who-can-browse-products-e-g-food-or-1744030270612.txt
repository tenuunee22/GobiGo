1. User Types and Registration:
Customers (Individual): Users who can browse products (e.g., food or other items), place orders, and make payments.

Businesses (Store Owners): Restaurant or store owners who can register, add products for sale, and manage orders.

Delivery Personnel (Driver/Delivery Vehicle): Users who register as delivery drivers/vehicles to accept and deliver orders.

2. Core Features:
User Registration & Authentication:

Create a registration flow for customers, businesses, and delivery personnel, with different user roles stored in Firestore.

Use Firebase for authentication (email/password or third-party login).

Once logged in, direct users to specific pages based on their user role (e.g., Individual goes to /profile/user, Store goes to /dashboard/store, Delivery goes to /dashboard/driver).

Product Management (For Businesses):

Allow store owners to add products to the system, specifying names, prices, descriptions, images, and categories.

Implement a product catalog that customers can browse, search, and filter by type.

Order Management (For Customers and Businesses):

Customers should be able to select items from businesses, add them to the cart, and place an order.

Businesses should have an interface where they can view incoming orders, accept or decline them, and manage the status of each order.

Notifications should be sent to businesses when a new order is placed.

Delivery Management (For Delivery Personnel):

Once an order is accepted by the business, delivery personnel should be able to see the details of the order (pickup location, delivery location, etc.).

Implement a system where delivery personnel can accept or reject delivery assignments.

Delivery personnel should be able to track the order's progress in real-time.

Real-time Location Tracking:

Integrate real-time location tracking for delivery personnel using Firebase and Google Maps.

Show customers and businesses the live status of deliveries on a map.

Payment Integration:

Integrate a payment gateway like QPay for customers to pay for their orders online.

3. Tech Stack:
Frontend (Web): Next.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive and fast user interfaces.

Backend: Firebase for user authentication, Firestore for storing user data, products, and orders.

Maps & Location: Google Maps API or another map service for location tracking.

Payment Integration: QPay or another online payment system for order payments.

Mobile App: Flutter for iOS and Android app development.

4. Steps to Develop:
Step 1: Set up your Firebase project and integrate authentication.

Step 2: Build the user registration and login process with role selection (Individual, Store, Delivery).

Step 3: Create a product management system for stores to add, edit, and delete products.

Step 4: Develop the customer order system, where users can browse, select, and pay for items.

Step 5: Implement the delivery personnel tracking and order management system.

Step 6: Add location tracking and real-time updates using Firebase.

Step 7: Integrate QPay for payment processing.

Step 8: Develop a mobile app with Flutter, ensuring it mirrors the functionality of the website.

By following this structure, you'll create a functional GobiGo platform that connects all the key players in the food delivery ecosystem: customers, businesses, and delivery personnel.
